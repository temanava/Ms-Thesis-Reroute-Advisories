This folder contains the code used to predict the volume-related reroute advisories. 
Datasets used were TFMS to collect all reroute advisories between January and april 2017 and traffic count data per facility.

1. Fuse volume and reroute data with the code 'FuseVoumeTraffic.py'
2. Implement and test machine learning algorithms in R with the code 'VolumePrediction_v3.R' on two predictions:
          - prediction of the issuance of volume reroute advisory
          - prediction of the issuance and the type of volume reroute advisory
